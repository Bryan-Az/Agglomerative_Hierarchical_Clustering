# Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
For this assignment, the scipy cluster library was deployed to create dendograms, cluster, and then visualize the clusters.
The dendograms helped find an appropriate t-value for the cluster function, which was then used to visualize the results on a scatter plot.
## Single Linkage Method
This one had the lowest t value (2) and the most clusters (8)
## Average Linkage Method
This one has higher t (5) and 50% less clusters than the single linkage method. (more agglomerative)
## Complete Linkage Method
This one has the same t as average method (5) and the least amount of clusters (3) than the rest. (most agglomerative)

The same data was used on each method as an ablative experiment of clustering.
